# Fast-Fourier-Transform
Digital Designing and implementation of 32-point FFT block using Cooley-Tukey algorithm with 5- stages pipelining, stages time sharing, Designed from High Level modelling, RTL modelling to logic synthesis.
First Go to the OFDM and FFT slides to understand what problem the project is here to solve.
then go to the paper of "fpga-based-design-and-simulation-of-32-point-fft-through-radix-2-dit-algorithm" to understand the cooly-tuky algorithm (Optional).
Go to the Project decoumentation to understand what has been done in that project.
Finally, enjoy the Codes :)
